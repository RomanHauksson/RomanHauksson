# Hi, my name’s Roman!

I'm currently in my 4th year studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas under a National Merit Scholarship. I also work as a software engineer at Baby Steps, a startup helping prospective parents decide which IVF clinic to go to using personalized success rate predictions for each clinic in the US.
