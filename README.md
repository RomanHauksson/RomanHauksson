# Hi, my name’s Roman!

I believe the next decade may bring unprecedented technological advancement and rapid societal changes because of superintelligent AI. My life mission is to help make sure this transition goes well.

I'm currently in my 4th year studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas under a National Merit Scholarship. I also work as a software engineer at Baby Steps, a startup helping prospective parents decide which IVF clinic to go to using personalized success rate predictions for each clinic in the US.
